  'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better fi nish the story for yourself.'
  'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I dare say there may be one .'
  'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. 'And so these three little sisters-they were learning to draw, you know-'
  'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
  'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
  'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place on.'
  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse o ff than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
  Alice did not wish to o ff end the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously:   'But   I   don't   understand.   Where   did   they   draw   the   treacle from?'
  'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well-eh, stupid?'
  'But they were in the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.
  'Of course they were,' said the Dormouse; '-well in.'
  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.
  'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of things-everything that begins with an M-'
  'Why with an M?' said Alice.
  'Why not?' said the March Hare.
  Alice was silent.
  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going o ff into a

context: |-
  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed 'O ff with her head! O ff -'
  'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'
  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them over!'
  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
  'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.
  'Leave o ff that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What have you been doing here?'
  'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying-'
  '  see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. I 'O ff with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.
  'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large fl ower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched o ff after the others.
  'Are their heads o ff ?' shouted the Queen.
  'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted in reply.
  'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'
  The  soldiers   were   silent,   and   looked   at   Alice,   as   the   question   was evidently meant for her.
  'Yes!' shouted Alice.
  'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.
  'It's-it's a very fi ne day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
  'Very,' said Alice: '-where's the Duchess?'

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks who the Queen ordered to turn over the gardeners. The context mentions the Queen telling the Knave 'Turn them over!' and the soldiers executing the gardeners, but it does not specify that the Queen directly ordered the soldiers or anyone else to turn over the gardeners. The only explicit command from the Queen is to the Knave, and the soldiers' actions are described as following orders or actions taken by others. Therefore, the context does not unambiguously identify a specific individual the Queen ordered to turn over the gardeners.
    rating: 2
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage 'The Knave' only mentions the Knave's action of turning over the cards carefully with one foot, which is directly described in the context. However, it does not provide additional information about the Knave's role, intentions, or other actions beyond this specific moment. Therefore, the passage can be fully inferred from the context regarding the Knave's action in that scene, but it does not encompass broader details or implications.
    rating: 4
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question specifically asks about the Queen's order to turn over the gardeners, which directly relates to the part of the context where the Queen commands 'Turn them over!' and the subsequent action involving the gardeners. The context provides detailed information about this event, making it highly pertinent and specific for retrieval.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question refers to a specific historical or fictional event involving the Queen and gardeners, which requires contextual knowledge to understand the scenario and identify the individuals involved.
    rating: 2
  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question is specific and relates to a historical or royal event involving the Queen and gardeners, which could be relevant for documents covering royal history or specific incidents. Its usefulness depends on the scope of the document collection, but generally, it targets a niche detail that may not be broadly applicable.
    rating: 3
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context provides multiple descriptive statements about characters, their actions, and interactions in a scene from a story, which can be useful for extracting specific details or understanding the narrative. However, it does not contain explicit explanations, thematic analysis, or technical details that would be highly valuable for domain-specific knowledge extraction. Therefore, it offers some useful information but is limited in depth.
    rating: 3
  c_clarity:
    evaluation: The context provides a detailed and coherent excerpt from a narrative, with clear dialogue and descriptive actions. The formatting is consistent, making it easy to follow the sequence of events and character interactions. There are minor typographical issues (e.g., spacing in 'O ff' and 'see!'), but they do not significantly hinder understanding.
    rating: 4
  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer 'The Knave' directly responds to the question about who the Queen ordered, providing a specific individual. The question and answer are closely linked, with the answer clarifying the subject of the query, but they do not repeat the same information verbatim. Instead, the answer adds a specific detail to the question, making it more informative.

question: Based on the Queen's repeated commands and the gardeners' subsequent disappearance, what can be inferred about the Queen's authority and the outcome of her orders in this scene?
answer: It can be inferred that the Queen's authority was absolute in this scene, as her commands led to the gardeners being beheaded and their heads removed, demonstrating her power to enforce her will without opposition.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks about the Queen's authority and the outcome of her commands based on her repeated orders and the gardeners' disappearance. The context provides multiple instances of the Queen issuing commands, her anger, and the gardeners' subsequent execution, which directly illustrate her authority and the consequences of her orders. Therefore, the context contains sufficient information to answer the question unambiguously.
    rating: 5
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage suggests that the Queen's commands resulted in the gardeners being beheaded and their heads removed, indicating a display of significant authority. The context describes her ordering the gardeners to be executed and their heads being gone, which supports the inference of her strong authority. However, it does not explicitly state that her authority was absolute or uncontested, only that her commands were carried out. Therefore, the inference about her authority being 'absolute' is somewhat supported but not entirely unambiguous.
    rating: 3
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question specifically references the Queen's repeated commands and the gardeners' disappearance, which are directly depicted in the context. It asks about the Queen's authority and the outcome of her orders, both of which are clearly illustrated through her commands, her anger, and the subsequent events. Therefore, the context provides sufficient and pertinent information to answer the question.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question references a specific scene involving a Queen, commands, and gardeners, which implies it depends on the context of that scene or story to interpret the inference about authority and outcomes.
    rating: 1

    evaluation: The question prompts analysis of authority dynamics and consequences within a specific scene, which is useful for understanding character interactions and narrative implications. It is relevant for users seeking to interpret literary or theatrical scenes involving leadership and obedience.
    rating: 4
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context provides multiple detailed interactions and descriptions of characters, including the Queen's temper, the execution of gardeners, and Alice's reactions, which can be useful for extracting statements about character behavior, plot events, and setting details in the story. It offers enough varied information to support a range of statements relevant to the subject.

  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer directly addresses the inference about the Queen's authority based on her commands and their consequences, which are already implied in the question. It essentially restates the same information about her authority and the outcome, making it a tautological response.

  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might fi nd another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME,' beautifully printed on it in large letters.
  It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. 'No, I'll look fi rst,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked ' poison '   or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your fi nger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
  However, this bottle was not marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and fi nding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed fl avour of cherry-

  'What can all   that   green   stu ff be?'   said   Alice.   'And   where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to fi nd that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had fl own into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.
  'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
  'I'm not a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'
  'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!'
  'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.
  'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents! There's
  no pleasing them!'
  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had fi nished.
  'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon; 'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'
  'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.
  'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'

context: |-
  'What can all   that   green   stu ff be?'   said   Alice.   'And   where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to fi nd that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had fl own into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.
  'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
  'I'm not a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'
  'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!'
  'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.
  'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents! There's
  no pleasing them!'
  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had fi nished.
  'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon; 'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'
  'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.
  'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'
question: Based on the pigeon’s distress and its efforts to guard its eggs, what can be inferred about the pigeon’s priorities and concerns in this scene?
answer: The pigeon’s primary concern is protecting its eggs from serpents, which causes it to be constantly vigilant and exhausted, indicating that its maternal duties are its main priority.

  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'
  'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting o ff the subjects on his fl appers, '-Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling-the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught   us   Drawling,   Stretching,   and   Fainting   in Coils.'
  'What was that like?' said Alice.
  'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too sti ff . And the Gryphon never learnt it.'
  'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, he was.'
  'I  never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'
  'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.
  'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.
  'Ten hours the fi rst day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on.' 'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.
  'That's   the   reason   they're   called   lessons,'   the   Gryphon   remarked: 'because they lessen from day to day.'
  This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?'
  'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
  'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.
  'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: 'tell her something about the games now.'

  'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.
  'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history.'
  As they walked o ff together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, that's a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.
  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;' and she walked o ff , leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.

context: |-
  There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
  'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak fi rst, 'why your cat grins like that?'
  'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'
  She   said   the   last   word   with   such   sudden   violence   that   Alice   quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:-
  'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats could grin.'
  'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'
  'I   don't   know   of   any   that   do,'   Alice   said   very   politely,   feeling   quite
  pleased to have got into a conversation.
  'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'
  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fi x on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup o ff the fi re, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby-the fi re-irons came fi rst; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her;   and   the   baby   was   howling   so   much   already,   that   it   was   quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
  'Oh, please mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his precious nose!' as an unusually large saucepan fl ew close by it, and very nearly carried it o ff .
  'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'

  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.

  'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be o ff ,   and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'
  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

  'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, 'that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I sleep when I breathe'!'
  'It is the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much.
  The Hatter was the fi rst to break the silence. 'What day of the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
  Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'
  'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
  'It was the best butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.
  'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled: 'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'
  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his fi rst remark, 'It was the best butter, you know.'
  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'
  'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does your watch tell you what year it is?'
  'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'
question: What day of the month did Alice say it was?
answer: The fourth.

question: Based on the conversation, why might the characters find the watch unusual or amusing?
answer: They find the watch unusual because it only shows the day of the month and not the time, and it remains the same year for a long time, which is different from typical watches.

  'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
  Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell 'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.
  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one fi nger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
  'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.
  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-
  'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!'
  'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
  'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great deal to come before that!'
  'Call the fi rst witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'
  The fi rst witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite fi nished my tea when I was sent for.'

  'The fi rst thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to fi nd my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.'
  It   sounded   an   excellent   plan,   no   doubt,   and   very   neatly   and   simply arranged; the only di ffi culty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.
  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air o ff all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way o ff ,   panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set o ff at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
question: What are the main events that happen to Alice and the puppy in the story?
answer: Alice tries to coax a puppy, which then plays with a stick and eventually sits down panting, leading Alice to escape.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The context describes Alice's encounter with a puppy, including her interactions and the puppy's behavior, but it does not mention any events involving Alice and a puppy together in a story with a sequence of main events. The question asks about the main events that happen to both Alice and the puppy, which is not fully answered by the given excerpt, as it focuses mainly on Alice's actions and the puppy's behavior without detailing a broader sequence of events involving both characters.
    rating: 2
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: 'The passage summarizes the key events described in the context: Alice attempting to coax the puppy, the puppy playing with a stick, and finally sitting down panting, which prompts Alice to escape. All these details are directly supported by the context, making the passage a clear and accurate condensation of the original story segment.'
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question asks about the main events involving Alice and the puppy, which are described in detail in the context. The context provides specific actions and interactions between Alice and the puppy, making it highly relevant and specific to the question.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question refers to a specific story involving Alice and a puppy, which implies it depends on the context or the particular story being discussed. Without additional information about the story, the question is not fully understandable.
    rating: 1
  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question is specific to a particular story involving Alice and a puppy, which would be highly relevant if the document collection contains detailed summaries or analyses of that story. If the collection includes the story or related content, this question would be very useful for extracting key plot points. However, if the collection is more general or unrelated, its usefulness diminishes.
    rating: 4
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context provides a detailed description of Alice's interaction with a puppy, including her intentions, her reactions, and the puppy's behavior. It offers insights into her problem-solving approach, her emotional state, and the nature of the puppy, which could be useful for extracting statements about character behavior, animal interactions, and narrative details in the subject domain.
    rating: 4
  c_clarity:
    evaluation: The context is well-written, with clear narration, proper formatting, and complete sentences. It provides a coherent excerpt from a story, making it easy to understand and follow.
    rating: 5
  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer provides a summary of the events involving Alice and the puppy, but it introduces specific details not explicitly asked for in the question, such as the puppy playing with a stick and sitting down panting. The question asks generally about the main events, and the answer elaborates on particular actions, adding new information rather than merely repeating the question. Therefore, the answer contains some new details beyond the question's scope.

  'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:
  'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it-' 'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.
  'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
  'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
  The Mock Turtle went on.
  'We had the best of educations-in fact, we went to school every day-'
  ' I've been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud as all that.'
  'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
  'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'
  'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.
  'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.
  'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. 'Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, 'French, music, and washing -extra.''
  'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of the sea.'
  'I couldn't a ff ord to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I only took the regular course.'
  'What was that?' inquired Alice.
  'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle replied; 'and then the di ff erent   branches   of   Arithmetic-Ambition,   Distraction, Ugli fi cation, and Derision.'
  'I never heard of 'Ugli fi cation,'' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?' The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks about the subjects Alice said she learned at her school. The context explicitly mentions that Alice learned French and music at her school, providing clear and direct information to answer the question unambiguously.
    rating: 5
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage explicitly mentions that Alice learned French and music at her school, and the Mock Turtle also references these subjects. The context clearly supports the inference that 'French and music' are part of the educational topics discussed, making this a direct and unambiguous connection.
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question specifically asks about the subjects Alice learned at her school, and the context provides direct information about her subjects, including French and music, as well as a brief mention of her attending a day-school. This makes it highly relevant and specific for retrieval.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question refers to a specific person (Alice) and her experiences at her school, which are context-dependent details. Without additional context about Alice or her school, the question cannot be fully understood or answered.
    rating: 1
  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question is specific to Alice's statements about her school subjects, which would be useful if the documents contain detailed information about her education or personal statements. It is moderately useful for understanding individual experiences or educational background, but may not be broadly applicable to general knowledge about school subjects.
    rating: 3
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context provides a detailed excerpt from a literary work, including character dialogues and descriptions that could be useful for analyzing language, character interactions, and thematic elements. However, it does not contain explicit factual statements or technical information that would directly support extracting domain-specific statements. Therefore, it offers some value but limited in scope.
    rating: 3
  c_clarity:
    evaluation: The context is a well-structured excerpt from a dialogue, with clear attribution of speakers and coherent flow of conversation. The formatting is consistent, and the content is complete, making it easy to understand the scene and the humor involved.
    rating: 5
  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer provides specific subjects that Alice learned, which directly addresses the question but does not repeat the question's wording or structure. It introduces new information about the subjects, so it is not a tautological repetition.

context: |-
  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, and left o ff when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'
  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one fi nger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, ' Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.'
  'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.
  'Why, she , of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one fi nger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'
  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of com fi ts, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.
  'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.
  'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
  'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
  'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;' and, when it had fi nished this short speech, they all cheered.

    rating: 5
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage provides detailed information about the Dodo's actions and statements during the race event, including its role in declaring the race over, its decision that everyone has won, and its interaction with Alice regarding prizes. The context explicitly describes the Dodo's behavior and dialogue, which directly supports the statements in the passage. Therefore, all statements in the passage can be fully inferred from the context.
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question directly references a specific event in the context where the Dodo calls out that the race is over, and it asks who made that call. The context provides detailed information about this moment, including the Dodo's declaration and the subsequent reactions, making it highly pertinent and specific to the question.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question is self-contained and does not rely on any external context or prior information to be understood; it clearly asks about a specific event involving a race and a caller.

question: Why did Alice feel despair when asked what prize she received, and what does this suggest about her role in the event?

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The context describes Alice's participation in a race and the subsequent awarding of prizes, including her feeling of despair when asked about her prize. The question asks why she felt despair and what this suggests about her role. The context provides details about her being asked to give out prizes and her only having a thimble, which she feels sad about. This information allows us to infer her feelings and her role as a prize distributor, but it does not explicitly state her internal emotional state or her role beyond the event. Therefore, the question can be answered with some inference but not with complete certainty.
    rating: 3
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage explicitly states that Alice had only a thimble in her pocket and that she was awarded it as a prize, which aligns with her feeling of despair due to the modest prize. It also indicates she was not a participant in the race but was given a token for her role, consistent with the context where prizes are handed out to everyone, including Alice. Therefore, all statements in the passage can be directly inferred from the context.
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question asks about Alice's emotional response of despair and its implications for her role, which directly relates to her being asked about her prize and her subsequent inability to provide a suitable one.

This information is pertinent to understanding her feelings and role in the event.

context: |-
  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood-(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fi sh)-and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'   The   Frog-Footman   repeated,   in   the   same   solemn   tone,   only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
  'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for two reasons.   First,   because   I'm   on   the   same   side   of   the   door   as   you   are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within-a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
  'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'
question: What was the invitation from the Queen about?

context: |-
  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood-(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fi sh)-and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'   The   Frog-Footman   repeated,   in   the   same   solemn   tone,   only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
  'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for two reasons.   First,   because   I'm   on   the   same   side   of   the   door   as   you   are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within-a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
  'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'
question: Why did Alice decide to run back into the wood after laughing at the footmen's entangled curls?
answer: Because she was afraid that the footmen might hear her laughing.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks why Alice decided to run back into the wood after laughing at the footmen's entangled curls. The context describes Alice laughing at the curled curls of the footmen and then running back into the wood out of fear that they might hear her. This provides a clear reason for her action, directly linked to her laughter and the concern about being overheard. Therefore, the context supplies sufficient information to answer the question unambiguously.
    rating: 5
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage states that Alice laughed so much that she had to run back into the wood for fear of the footmen hearing her, which directly supports the statement that she was afraid that the footmen might hear her laughing. The context provides a clear cause-and-effect relationship between her laughter and her fear of being overheard, making this inference straightforward and unambiguous.

  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her fi rst  idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you fi nd a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
  'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to fi nd her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'
  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way o ff , and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at fi rst she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
  'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse-of a mouse-to a mouse-a mouse-O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks about features Alice observes on the English coast based on her previous experience. The context describes Alice's fall into a pool of tears and her observations of the seaside environment, including bathing machines, children digging in the sand, lodging houses, and a railway station. These are features she notes from her past experience of the coast, which are explicitly mentioned in the context.
    rating: 5
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage describes Alice's general impression of the seaside environment, including bathing machines, children digging in the sand, lodging houses, and a railway station, which aligns with her observations in the context. However, it does not specify that she is observing these things at the exact moment she falls into the pool of tears or that she is directly recalling her previous visit. The context provides her overall mental state and setting, but the passage's specific statement about her observing these elements is more of a summarized description rather than a direct inference from her current situation. Therefore, the connection is somewhat implied but not explicitly detailed.

  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down o ff the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, 'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.'
  'One side of what? The other side of what? ' thought Alice to herself.
  'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
  Alice   remained   looking   thoughtfully   at   the   mushroom   for   a   minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round,   she   found   this   a   very   di ffi cult   question.   However,   at   last   she
  stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke o ff a bit of the edge with each hand.
  'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the e ff ect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.

  'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks about what the Caterpillar said regarding the two sides of the mushroom. The context provides the Caterpillar's remark about the sides making you grow taller or shorter, and Alice's thoughts about which side is which, but it does not specify what the Caterpillar explicitly said about the sides beyond that remark. Therefore, the question is answerable but not with complete detail or clarity, as the specific statement of the Caterpillar is only partially given.

  'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the e ff ect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.

  'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
question: What challenges did Alice face when trying to identify the two sides of the mushroom, and how did she attempt to determine which side was which?
answer: Alice found it difficult to identify the two sides of the round mushroom, so she broke off a bit from each side and tested them by nibbling, which led to her shrinking unexpectedly.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The context provides information about Alice examining the mushroom and trying to identify its two sides, including her attempt to break off parts and test them. It also mentions her difficulty in distinguishing the sides and her method of nibbling to determine their effects. Therefore, the question about the challenges Alice faced and her attempts to identify the sides is well-supported by the context.
    rating: 5
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage describes Alice's difficulty in identifying the two sides of the mushroom, her breaking off parts from each side, and testing them by nibbling, which causes her to shrink unexpectedly. The context explicitly mentions her trying to determine the sides of the mushroom, breaking off a bit from each, and nibbling to test the effect, followed by her shrinking. Therefore, all statements in the passage are directly supported by the context.
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question asks about the specific challenges Alice faced in identifying the two sides of the mushroom and her methods to determine which was which. The context provides detailed information about Alice's observation of the mushroom, her attempt to break off parts to test them, and her reasoning process.

context: |-
  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down o ff the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, 'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.'
  'One side of what? The other side of what? ' thought Alice to herself.
  'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
  Alice   remained   looking   thoughtfully   at   the   mushroom   for   a   minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round,   she   found   this   a   very   di ffi cult   question.   However,   at   last   she
  stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke o ff a bit of the edge with each hand.

question: Based on Alice's actions and the consequences she faced, what can be inferred about the nature of the mushroom's sides and their effects?
answer: It can be inferred that the sides of the mushroom have magical or unpredictable effects, as attempting to identify them caused Alice to shrink rapidly, indicating the sides are not straightforward or safe to test.

  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
  The next thing was to eat the com fi ts:   this   caused   some   noise   and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
  'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why it is you hate-C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be o ff ended again.
  'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.
  'It is a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:-
  ```
  'Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, 'Let us both go to law: I will prosecute you.-Come, I'll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've nothing to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such
  ```
  ```
  a trial, dear sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' Said cunning old Fury: 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.''
  ```
  'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you thinking of?'
  'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fi fth bend, I think?'
  'I had not! ' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
  'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'
question: What did Alice do after she thought the whole thing was very absurd?
answer: She bowed, took the thimble, and looked as solemn as she could.

context: |-
  'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, 'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'
  'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
  'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: 'any shrimp could have told you that.'
  'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, 'Keep back, please: we don't want you with us!''
  'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no wise fi sh would go anywhere without a porpoise.'
  'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
  'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fi sh came to me , and told me he was going a journey, I should say 'With what porpoise?''
  'Don't you mean 'purpose'?' said Alice.
  'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an o ff ended tone. And the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of your adventures.'
  'I could tell you my adventures-beginning from this morning,' said Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a di ff erent person then.'
  'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.
  'No, no! The adventures fi rst,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: 'explanations take such a dreadful time.'
  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she fi rst saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at fi rst, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and
  mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating ' You are old, Father William ,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming di ff erent, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said 'That's very curious.'

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks about the composition of 'boots and shoes under the sea,' but the context provides a playful, metaphorical description involving a song and characters discussing what 'boots and shoes' are made of, with a humorous answer 'soles and eels.' It does not specify actual materials or real objects, but rather a whimsical answer within a fictional setting. Therefore, the question is answerable in a figurative or humorous sense, but not unambiguously in a literal or factual way.
    rating: 3
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage 'Soles and eels' is directly mentioned in the context as part of the Gryphon's explanation about what boots and shoes are made of, which Alice questions. All other statements in the passage are either about the characters' reactions or their subsequent conversation, which are not explicitly inferable from the context. Therefore, only the statement 'Soles and eels' can be fully inferred from the context.
    rating: 1
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question asks about the composition of 'boots and shoes under the sea,' which directly references the phrase used in the passage. The context provides a clear explanation involving a gryphon and a mock turtle discussing what 'boots and shoes under the sea' are made of, specifically 'soles and eels.' This makes the context highly relevant and specific to the question.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question is about the composition of 'boots and shoes under the sea,' which is a metaphorical or poetic phrase, but it does not rely on any specific external context or document to be understood. It is self-contained in asking about the materials or substances involved.
    rating: 5
  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question seeks specific information about the composition of 'boots and shoes under the sea,' which is a metaphorical or specialized topic likely related to marine biology, geology, or underwater equipment. Its usefulness depends on the context of the document collection; if the collection covers marine materials, underwater gear, or geological formations, it could be quite relevant. However, without context, it appears somewhat vague and potentially less useful for a broad audience.
    rating: 3
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context provides a detailed excerpt from a literary work, including character dialogues, descriptions of characters' thoughts, and narrative progression. It contains multiple statements that could be useful for extracting information about the characters, their interactions, and the storyline, which would be valuable for someone with domain knowledge in literature or the specific text. However, it does not include explicit explanations or technical details, limiting its usefulness for in-depth analysis beyond narrative understanding.
    rating: 4
  c_clarity:
    evaluation: The context is a well-structured excerpt from a narrative, containing clear dialogue and descriptive passages. The formatting is consistent, with proper punctuation and spacing, making it easy to follow. There are minor typographical issues such as inconsistent spacing in words like 'fi sh' and 'di ff erent,' which may slightly affect readability but do not significantly hinder understanding.
    rating: 4
  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer 'Soles and eels' provides a pun-based response that references 'soles' (a part of shoes) and 'eels' (sea creatures), but it does not directly repeat or restate the question's inquiry about the materials of boots and shoes under the sea. Instead, it offers a playful, indirect answer with new information.

  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir-' The Rabbit started violently,
  dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little di ff erent. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!' And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

  Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. 'What sort of people live about here?'
  'In that direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives a Hatter: and in that direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'
  'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
  'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.'

  'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now   growl when I'm pleased, and wag my I tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'
  '  call it purring, not growling,' said Alice. I
  'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?'
  'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited yet.'
  'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
  Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
  things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.
  'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly forgotten to ask.'

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks about who lives in the direction Alice was told about. The context mentions that the Cat points in two directions, each with a different inhabitant (Hatter and March Hare), but does not specify who lives in which direction or who Alice was told about specifically. Therefore, the question cannot be answered unambiguously based solely on the given information.
    rating: 2

  'I don't much care where-' said Alice.
  'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.
  '-so long as I get somewhere ,' Alice added as an explanation.
  'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long enough.'
  Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. 'What sort of people live about here?'
  'In that direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives a Hatter: and in that direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'
  'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
  'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.'
  'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.
  'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'
  Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how do you know that you're mad?'
  'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?' 'I suppose so,' said Alice.

question: Based on the conversation, why does the Cat say that Alice must be mad for coming to this place?

  This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
  'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
  'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. 'No,' said the Caterpillar.
  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it pu ff ed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think you're changed, do you?'
  'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I used-and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
  'Can't remember what things?' said the Caterpillar.
  'Well, I've tried to say 'How doth the little busy bee,' but it all came di ff erent!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
  'Repeat, ' You are old, Father William ,'' said the Caterpillar.
  Alice folded her hands, and began:-
  'You are old, Father William,' the young man said, 'And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your headDo you think, at your age, it is right?'
  'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son, 'I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.'
  'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door-
  Pray, what is the reason of that?'
  'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, 'I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment-one shilling the boxAllow me to sell you a couple?'

As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. ''Whoever lives there,'' thought Alice, ''it''ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!'' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.'
question: Why does Alice decide to reduce her size to nine inches before approaching the house?
answer: Because she believes that coming upon the house at her current size would frighten its inhabitants, so she reduces her size to avoid causing alarm.

  And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the fl ame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
  After a while, fi nding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
  'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave o ff this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!'

  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. 'I know something interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll
  make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough-I hope I shan't grow any more-As it is, I can't get out at the door-I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!'
  Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the fl oor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the e ff ect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?'
  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full e ff ect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

context: |-
  The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it was,' he said.
  'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
  'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
  'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
  'Take o ff your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
  'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
  ' Stolen! ' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
  'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'
  Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fi dgeted.
  'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.'
  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.
  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at fi rst she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.
  'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'
  'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'
  'You've no right to grow here ,' said the Dormouse.
  'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing too.'
  'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.
question: What date did the Hatter think it was?

  (In which the cook and the baby joined):
  'Wow! wow! wow!'
  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:-
  'I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes;
  For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!'
  'Wow! wow! wow!'
  'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice, fl inging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
  Alice caught the baby with some di ffi culty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just like a starfi sh,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the fi rst minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. 'If I don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left o ff sneezing by this time). 'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.'

context: |-
  (In which the cook and the baby joined):
  'Wow! wow! wow!'
  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:-
  'I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes;
  For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!'
  'Wow! wow! wow!'
  'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice, fl inging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
  Alice caught the baby with some di ffi culty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just like a starfi sh,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the fi rst minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. 'If I don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left o ff sneezing by this time). 'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.'
question: What actions did the Duchess perform while singing, and how did Alice respond to the baby?
answer: The Duchess sang the second verse of the song while tossing the baby violently, causing it to howl, and Alice caught the baby, which was a queer-shaped creature that she struggled to hold and nurse properly.

  'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Où est ma chatte?' which was the fi rst sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'
  'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would you like cats if you were me?'
  'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fi re, licking her paws and washing her face-and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse-and she's such a capital one for catching mice-oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really o ff ended. 'We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.'
  'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'

context: |-
  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the o ffi cers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head fi rst, and then sat upon it.)
  'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, 'There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the o ffi cers of the court,' and I never understood what it meant till now.'
  'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the King.
  'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the fl oor, as it is.' 'Then you may sit down,' the King replied.
  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
  'Come, that fi nished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get on better.'
  'I'd rather fi nish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
  'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.
  '-and just take his head o ff outside,' the Queen added to one of the o ffi cers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the o ffi cer could get to the door.
  'Call the next witness!' said the King.
  The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
  'Give your evidence,' said the King.
  'Shan't,' said the cook.
  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
  'Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.'
question: What method did the officers of the court use to suppress the guinea-pigs' cheers?
answer: They slipped the guinea-pig into a large canvas bag, tied it up at the mouth with strings, and sat upon it.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The context describes the method used by officers of the court to suppress the guinea-pigs' cheers, specifically placing them into a canvas bag and sitting on it. The question asks about the method used, which is explicitly explained in the context.

  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage describes the specific action of slipping the guinea-pig into a canvas bag and sitting upon it, which is explicitly explained in the context. The context provides detailed information about how the guinea-pig was suppressed, including the use of a canvas bag and sitting upon it, making the statement in the passage directly inferable from the context.
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question specifically asks about the method used by officers of the court to suppress the guinea-pigs' cheers, and the context provides a detailed description of how the guinea-pigs were physically placed into a canvas bag and sat upon to suppress their cheers. This direct description makes the context highly relevant and specific to the question.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question references 'officers of the court' and 'guinea-pigs' cheers' without additional context, making it unclear what specific scenario or document it pertains to. It relies on external information to understand the setting and the entities involved.
    rating: 1
  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question appears to be metaphorical or context-specific, possibly referencing a particular case, story, or analogy involving court officers and guinea-pigs. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine its relevance or usefulness for a domain-specific document collection. Therefore, its utility is limited unless the collection directly addresses this scenario or metaphor.
    rating: 2
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context provides multiple detailed statements about court proceedings involving guinea-pigs, court officers, the King, the Hatter, and the Duchess's cook, including descriptions of actions, dialogues, and humorous interpretations. This offers a variety of information that could be useful for someone with domain knowledge interested in the narrative, characters, or thematic elements.
    rating: 4
  c_clarity:
    evaluation: The context is well-structured, with clear dialogue and narrative descriptions. It contains complete sentences and provides enough detail to understand the scene. Minor formatting issues, such as inconsistent spacing in words like 'o ffi cers' and 'head o ff', slightly detract from clarity but do not significantly impair understanding.
    rating: 4
  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer provides a specific method used to suppress the guinea-pigs' cheers, which is different from the question's inquiry about the method used by officers of the court. Therefore, the answer introduces new information rather than repeating the question's content.

context: |-
  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the o ffi cers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head fi rst, and then sat upon it.)
  'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, 'There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the o ffi cers of the court,' and I never understood what it meant till now.'
  'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the King.
  'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the fl oor, as it is.' 'Then you may sit down,' the King replied.
  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
  'Come, that fi nished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get on better.'
  'I'd rather fi nish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
  'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.
  '-and just take his head o ff outside,' the Queen added to one of the o ffi cers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the o ffi cer could get to the door.
  'Call the next witness!' said the King.
  The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
  'Give your evidence,' said the King.
  'Shan't,' said the cook.
  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
  'Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.'
question: Based on the actions of the officers and the court's treatment of the guinea-pigs, what can be inferred about the overall tone or style of this court scene?
answer: The tone appears to be humorous and satirical, using absurd procedures and animal characters to parody real court scenes.

  ' Un important, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,
  'important-unimportant-unimportant-important-'   as   if   he   were
  trying which word sounded best.
  Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; 'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.
  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court .'
  Everybody looked at Alice.
  ' I'm not a mile high,' said Alice.
  'You are,' said the King.
  'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
  'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'
  'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
  'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
  'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked up.' 'What's in it?' said the Queen.
  'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to-to somebody.'
  'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
  'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
  'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's nothing written on the outside .' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
  'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks for the specific rule number that the King reads from his book. The context clearly states that the King reads out 'Rule Forty-two,' which directly answers the question. Therefore, the question is unambiguously answerable based on the provided information.
    rating: 5
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage references 'Rule Forty-two' and discusses the context in which it is read aloud, including the court's reaction and some details about the rule's content. However, it does not explicitly state what 'Rule Forty-two' is or its significance beyond the scene. The context provides some background, but the passage itself does not fully explain or infer the rule's details or implications. Therefore, the inference is partial but not complete.

  'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if-if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let me see-how is it   to   be   managed?   I   suppose   I   ought   to   eat   or   drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'
  The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the fl owers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
  mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.

It offers insights into her observations, questions, and the setting, which could be useful for extracting statements related to character actions, environment, and specific characters like the caterpillar. However, it does not contain multiple distinct factual statements or technical details that would significantly enhance domain knowledge extraction.
    rating: 3
  c_clarity:
    evaluation: The context is well-written, with clear and complete sentences, proper formatting, and a coherent narrative that provides a vivid scene description. There are no obvious grammatical errors or ambiguities, making it easy to understand.
    rating: 5
  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer provides a plausible reason related to Alice's interest in finding food or satisfying curiosity, which is a different aspect from the question about her specific interest in the top of the mushroom. It introduces new information about her motivation rather than merely restating the question.

  'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) 'I'll give him sixpence.   don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.' I
  The jury all wrote down on their slates, ' She doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.
  'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to fi nd any. And yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. 'said I could not swim -' you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.
  The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he certainly did not , being made entirely of cardboard.)
  'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: '' We know it to be true -' that's the jury, of course-' I gave her one, they gave him two -' why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know-'
  'But, it goes on ' they all returned from him to you ,'' said Alice.
  'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than that . Then again-' before she had this fi t -' you never had fi ts, my dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.
  'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left o ff writing on his slate with one fi nger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
  'Then the words don't fi t you,' said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks what Alice offers to give if someone can explain the verse. The context explicitly states that Alice says, 'I'll give him sixpence.' Therefore, the question is directly answerable and unambiguous based on the provided information.
    rating: 5
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage mentions Alice offering a sixpence to anyone who can explain something, and the context discusses the concept of giving sixpence as a reward. The passage 'Sixpence' directly relates to this part of the context, making it possible to infer the connection between the two. However, the passage itself is very brief and does not provide additional details or context about the scene or characters involved, so the inference is limited to the association with the reward mentioned in the context.
    rating: 3
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question directly references the offer Alice makes in exchange for an explanation of the verse, which is explicitly described in the context. The context provides the specific offer ('I'll give him sixpence') in response to the challenge, making it highly pertinent and specific.

  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question is specific and directly related to a particular interaction involving Alice and a verse, which could be relevant in a context discussing literary analysis, character interactions, or thematic elements. It can help locate detailed explanations or dialogues involving Alice's offers, making it useful for users seeking in-depth understanding of that scene or character behavior.
    rating: 4
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context contains multiple dialogues and references to reasoning, interpretation, and specific characters involved in a court-like setting, which could be useful for extracting statements related to logic, interpretation, and character interactions within the subject domain. However, it is primarily a narrative excerpt with limited technical or domain-specific information, making it moderately useful for detailed extraction.
    rating: 3
  c_clarity:
    evaluation: The context is a well-structured excerpt from a narrative, containing dialogue and descriptive elements that are mostly clear and properly formatted. While it includes some complex sentences and dialogue tags, the overall clarity is maintained, and the formatting supports understanding. Minor issues such as inconsistent spacing or punctuation do not significantly hinder comprehension.
    rating: 4
  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer 'Sixpence' directly responds to the question about what Alice offers, providing specific information rather than repeating or elaborating on the question's content. Since the answer introduces new, concrete information that was not present in the question, it is not a tautological exchange.

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks about the perspectives of the King, Queen, and jury regarding the meaning of the verse. The context provides some insight into the King's thoughts and actions, mentions the jury's lack of explanation, and briefly references the Queen's reaction, but it does not explicitly detail their individual perspectives on the verse's meaning. Therefore, the context is insufficient to answer the question unambiguously.
    rating: 2
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage's statements about the King seeing some meaning in the verse, the Queen being furious and denying having fits, and the jury believing there is no meaning in it are all directly supported by the context. The context explicitly mentions the King observing some meaning, the Queen's furious reaction and denial of fits, and the jury's belief that there is no atom of meaning in the verse. Therefore, all statements in the passage can be unambiguously inferred from the context.
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question specifically asks about the perspectives of the King, Queen, and jury regarding the meaning of the verse, which are directly discussed in the context through their dialogues and attitudes. The context provides detailed insights into each character's view, making it highly relevant and specific for retrieval.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question references specific roles (King, Queen, jury) and a particular verse, implying a specific context or scenario that is not provided within the question itself. Without additional information about the setting, the verse, or the context in which these perspectives are considered, the question cannot be fully understood independently.
    rating: 1
  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question is specific to understanding the differing viewpoints of key characters (King, Queen, jury) on a particular verse, which is likely relevant in literary or theatrical analysis. It can help users explore character perspectives and interpretative nuances within the document collection.
    rating: 4
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context contains multiple dialogues and references to reasoning, interpretation, and specific characters involved in a court-like setting, which could be useful for extracting statements related to logic, interpretation, and character interactions within the subject domain. However, it is primarily a narrative excerpt with limited technical or domain-specific information, making it moderately useful for someone with domain knowledge.
    rating: 3
  c_clarity:
    evaluation: The context contains a lengthy excerpt from a narrative with multiple characters and dialogues, but it is somewhat disorganized and contains minor formatting issues such as inconsistent punctuation and spacing. Despite this, the overall content is fairly clear and provides a coherent scene from the story, allowing the reader to understand the interactions and the situation. The clarity could be improved with better formatting and punctuation, but it is sufficiently understandable as is.
    rating: 3

  'I know what 'it' means well enough, when I fi nd a thing,' said the Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop fi nd?'
  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, ''-found
  it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and o ff er him the crown. William's conduct at fi rst was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans-' How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.
  'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to dry me at all.'
  'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies -'
  'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.
  'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an o ff ended tone, 'was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
  'What is a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
  'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks about what the Duck generally finds 'it' to be, which is directly addressed in the first part of the context where the Duck says, 'it's generally a frog or a worm.' This makes the question answerable and unambiguous based on the given information.
    rating: 5
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage explicitly mentions the phrase 'a frog or a worm' in the context of the Duck's statement about knowing what 'it' means when finding a thing. Since this phrase is directly quoted and linked to the Duck's explanation, it can be fully inferred from the context. No other statements in the passage are directly related or can be inferred from the context provided.
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question specifically asks about what the Duck generally finds 'it' to be, which directly relates to the Duck's statement in the context. The context provides the Duck's explanation about 'it' meaning a frog or a worm, making the question highly pertinent and specific to this part of the passage.

    rating: 1
  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question appears to reference a specific phrase or context involving a duck and its perception of 'it,' which may be relevant in a collection discussing animal behavior, idiomatic expressions, or specific narratives. Its usefulness depends on the document collection's focus; if related to such topics, it could be quite useful. However, without additional context, it seems somewhat vague and potentially limited in scope.
    rating: 3
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context contains multiple references to characters, dialogues, and concepts from 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,' including discussions about a Caucus-race, character interactions, and narrative details.

  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer provides specific examples ('a frog or a worm') that the duck finds 'it' to be, which adds new information beyond the question's general inquiry about what the duck generally finds 'it' to be.

There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing o ff , and had just begun to dream that she   was   walking   hand   in   hand   with   Dinah,   and   saying   to   her   very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
question: Based on Alice's questions and thoughts, what can be inferred about her state of mind during her fall and her attitude towards her surroundings?
answer: Alice appears to be curious and imaginative, with a playful and dreamy attitude, as she questions her environment and animals around her, indicating she is in a whimsical, contemplative state rather than feeling frightened or anxious.

context: |-
  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers-she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes-and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister's dream.
  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by-the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool-she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering o ff her   unfortunate   guests   to   execution-once   more   the   pig-baby   was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it -once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slatepencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, fi lled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.
  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality-the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds-the rattling teacups would change to tinkling   sheep-bells,   and   the   Queen's   shrill   cries   to   the   voice   of   the shepherd boy-and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all   the   other   queer   noises,   would   change   (she   knew)   to   the   confused clamour of the busy farm-yard-while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.
  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the  after-time,   be   herself   a   grown   woman;   and   how   she   would   keep,
question: How does the narrator describe her feelings and perceptions while imagining herself in Wonderland?
answer: She feels as if she is in Wonderland, hearing and seeing the strange creatures and noises, but knows that opening her eyes would reveal dull reality.

  'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've had!'
  'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had fi nished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran o ff , thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-

  'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had fi nished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran o ff , thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-
question: What are some of the key events that happen to Alice during her encounter with the Queen and the pack of cards?
answer: Alice is accused of being nothing but a pack of cards, the cards fly at her, and she wakes up from her dream on her sister's lap.

  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage's statements about Alice being accused of being a pack of cards, the cards flying at her, and her waking up on her sister's lap are all explicitly described in the context. The context narrates Alice's confrontation with the Queen, the cards flying at her, and her subsequent awakening on her sister's lap, making these details directly inferable. Therefore, all statements in the passage can be unambiguously and entirely obtained from the context.
    rating: 5

  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'
  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.
  'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your history, she do.'
  'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've fi nished.'
  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, 'I don't see how he can ever fi nish, if he doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.
  'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real Turtle.'
  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.
  'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle-we used to call him Tortoise-'
  'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.
  'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle angrily: 'really you are very dull!'

context: |-
  The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fi ghting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting 'O ff with his head!' or 'O ff with her head!' about once in a minute.
  Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, 'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'
  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she   could   get   away   without   being   seen,   when   she   noticed   a   curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at fi rst, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself 'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'
  'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.
  Alice   waited   till   the   eyes   appeared,   and   then   nodded.   'It's   no   use speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her fl amingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
  'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak-and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them-and you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground-and I should have croqueted the   Queen's   hedgehog   just   now,   only   it   ran   away   when   it   saw   mine coming!'
question: What is the Queen doing when she becomes furious?

    evaluation: The passage explicitly mentions the Queen stamping about and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!', which directly corresponds to the statement in the passage. The context provides a detailed scene of the Queen's furious behavior, making this statement fully inferable. Therefore, the statement can be entirely and unambiguously obtained from the context.
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question specifically asks about the Queen's actions during her fury, which is directly described in the context as her stamping about and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!'. The context provides detailed information about her behavior at that moment, making it highly pertinent for retrieval.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question refers to a specific individual ('the Queen') and a particular emotional state ('becomes furious'), which implies a specific context or event that is not provided in the question itself. Without additional information about the situation or setting, the question cannot be understood independently.
    rating: 1
  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question seeks specific information about the Queen's actions and emotional state, which could be relevant for understanding her behavior or character in a particular context. Its usefulness depends on the document collection's focus on the Queen's actions, emotions, or specific events involving her. If the collection covers detailed narratives or character analyses, this question could be quite useful; otherwise, it may be less so.
    rating: 3
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context provides multiple descriptive statements about the Queen's temper, Alice’s feelings, the appearance of the Cheshire Cat, and details about the game of croquet, which can be useful for someone with domain knowledge to analyze character behaviors, settings, and specific events in the story.

context: |-
  'Which is just the case with mine ,' said the Hatter.
  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.
  'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.
  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'
  'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.
  'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'
  'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.
  'Nor I,' said the March Hare.
  Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'
  'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk about wasting it . It's him .'
  'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
  'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. 'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
  'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.'
  'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'
  ('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
  'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then-I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'
  'Not at fi rst, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.'

  'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'
  'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
  'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.
  'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.'
  'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!'
  The Queen had only one way of settling all di ffi culties, great or small. 'O ff with his head!' she said, without even looking round.
  'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he hurried o ff .
  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion.

The Queen then suggested executing the Cat, and the King eagerly agreed, showing a tendency to settle disputes with harsh measures. Meanwhile, Alice decided to leave the scene as the game was in chaos and she was concerned about the Queen's temper.

    evaluation: The answer provides a detailed explanation of Alice's reasoning for leaving, expanding on the initial question about her decision. It introduces new information about her perception of danger, the Queen's temperament, and the chaos, which are not explicitly stated in the question itself.

context: |-
  'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life.'
  'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your noseWhat made you so awfully clever?' 'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,' Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stu ff ? Be o ff , or I'll kick you down stairs!'
  'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
  'Not quite right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words have got altered.'
  'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.
  The Caterpillar was the fi rst to speak. 'What size do you want to be?' it asked.
  'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
  'I don't know,' said the Caterpillar.
  Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
  'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
  'Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,' said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'
  'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
  'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily o ff ended!'
  'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

  It   was   the   White   Rabbit,   trotting   slowly   back   again,   and   looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen-everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.
  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran o ff at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.
  'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How surprised he'll be when he fi nds out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves-that is, if I can fi nd them.' As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name 'W. RABBIT,' engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.
  'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: ''Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!' 'Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.' Only I don't think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!'

context: |-
  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank-the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
  The fi rst   question   of   course   was,   how   to   get   dry   again:   they   had   a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to fi nd herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than you, and must know better;' and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.
  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fi xed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
  'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria-''
  'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
  'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did you speak?'
  'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
  'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '-I proceed. 'Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable-''
  'Found what ?' said the Duck.
  'Found it ,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what 'it' means.'

  'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria-''
  'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
  'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did you speak?'
  'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
  'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '-I proceed. 'Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable-''
  'Found what ?' said the Duck.
  'Found it ,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what 'it' means.'

critiques:
  q_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The question asks about the specific events and interactions among the animals and Alice related to getting dry. The context describes a scene where animals and Alice are trying to get dry, including a consultation, a discussion with the Lory, and a speech by the Mouse. However, it does not detail the specific interactions or events that occur among the animals and Alice during their attempt to get dry, beyond the Mouse's speech and some general behavior. Therefore, the context provides some relevant information but lacks detailed descriptions of the interactions and events among Alice and the animals regarding getting dry.
    rating: 3
  a_to_c_groundedness:
    evaluation: The passage accurately summarizes the key events and interactions described in the context, including the animals' wet condition, their gathering in a ring to listen to the Mouse, the Mouse's offer to dry them, Alice's observation, and the discussion with the Lory about its age. All these elements are directly supported by the context, making the inference clear and complete.
    rating: 5
  q_feasibility:
    evaluation: The question specifically asks about the events and interactions among the animals and Alice related to getting dry, which is directly described in the context. The context details the animals' reactions, their conversations, and Alice's involvement during the drying process, making it highly pertinent and specific to the question.
    rating: 5
  stand_alone:
    evaluation: The question refers to a specific narrative involving animals, Alice, and their interactions, which suggests it depends on the context of a particular story or scene. Without that context, the question is not fully understandable.
    rating: 1
  q_usefulness:
    evaluation: The question focuses on specific events and interactions involving animals and Alice related to their attempt to get dry, which is likely a detailed scene or chapter in a narrative. It is useful for understanding character interactions and plot details in that context, especially for users interested in story analysis or character dynamics.
    rating: 4
  c_usefulness:
    evaluation: The context contains a detailed excerpt from a literary work, including character interactions, narrative descriptions, and some historical references. While it offers insights into the characters and their dialogue, it does not provide explicit factual statements or technical information that would be directly useful for extracting domain-specific statements. Therefore, its usefulness for someone with domain knowledge is limited.
    rating: 2
  c_clarity:
    evaluation: The context provides a detailed excerpt from a story with clear narration, dialogue, and descriptive elements. The formatting is consistent, and the content is coherent, making it easy to understand the scene and characters involved.
    rating: 5
  qa_tautology:
    evaluation: The answer expands on the events and interactions among the animals and Alice, providing additional details about the animals' discomfort, their gathering, and a specific interaction with the Lory, which were not explicitly mentioned in the question. Therefore, it introduces new information rather than merely repeating the question.
